str [ strcspn (str, “\n”)] = 0;

Parameters:
str : The string in which data has been stored using fgets()  i.e.(char *fgets(char *str, int n, FILE *stream))
“\n”: The character till which the length should be calculated


getchar() : 

The getchar() function in C reads a single character from the standard input,
 including the newline character generated when the Enter key is pressed. 
 To consume the newline character, you can call getchar() again after the 
 first call that reads the intended input. This second call will read and discard the 
 newline character, effectively removing it from the input buffer.
